**Question 1.** *Explain the difference between the sample space and the
event space. Write down the elements of the two spaces for the
experiment where a coin is tossed once (use the notation $H,\ T$ to
denote heads and tails).*

The event space is the collection of outcomes; a subset of the sample
space, possible individual outcomes. The sample space is
$\Omega=\{H,T\}$ whilst the event space is
$\mathcal{F}=\big\\{\emptyset,\{H\},\{T\},\Omega\big\\}$.

**Question 2.** *Consider an experiment with a countable (but possibly
infinite) sample space $\omega$ in which the individual outcomes are
denoted by $\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots$. Let $p_1,p_2\dots,$ be a
corresponding set of non-negative 'weights' with $\sum_ip_i=1$. For any
event $E\subseteq\omega$ define* 

$$
P(E)=\sum_{i:\omega_i\in E}p_i
$$ 

*Show
that the function $P()$ is a probability function (i.e. that it
satisfies Kolmogorov's three axioms).*

1.  $P(E)\ge 0$ is obvious$\quad \checkmark$

2.  $P(\Omega)=\sum_ip_i=1\quad \checkmark$

3.  $E,F$ disjoint.
  
    $$
    P(E\cup F)=\sum_{i:\omega_i\in E\cup F}p_i=\sum_{i:w_i\in E}p_i+\sum_{j:w_j\in F}p_j=P(E)+P(F)
    $$

**Question 3.** *Use the axioms of probability to prove that
$P(E^c)=1-P(E)$.*

Clearly $\Omega=E\cup E^c$ and $E,E^c$ are disjoint. Then by Axiom 2 and
3, 

$$
1=P(\Omega)=P(E)+P(E^c)
$$

**Question 4.** *Use the axioms of probability to prove that for any two
events $E$ and $F$,*

$$
P(E \cup F) =P(E) + P(F) - P(E \cap F)
$$

The trick is to find something that is disjoint. By repeated use of
Axiom 3, 

$$\begin{gathered}
    E\cup F=E\cup\big\{F\cap(E\cap F)^c\big\}\\
    P(E\cup F)=P(E)+P\big(F\cap(E\cap F)^c\big)\\
    F=(E\cap F)\cup\big(F\cap(E\cap F)^c\big)\\
    P(F)-P(E\cap F)=P\big(F\cap(E\cap F)^c\big)\end{gathered}
$$

**Question 5.** *Is it possible for two events to be mutually exclusive
and also independent?*

***3 Marks***

Mutually exclusive
$\iff P(E\cap F)=0\iff P(E)P(F)=0\iff P(E)=0\text{ or }P(F)=0$.

**Question 6.** *Suppose that $E$ and $F$ are two events with $P(F) > 0$.
Show that if $P(E|F) > P(E)$ then. $P(F|E) > P(F)$. Interpret this
result in words.*

$$
P(E|F)=\frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(F)}=\frac{P(F|E)P(E)}{P(F)}
$$

so

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{P(F|E)P(E)}{P(F)}&>P(E)\\
    \implies P(F|E)&>P(F)\end{aligned}
$$

$E$ and $F$ tend to occur
together more often than if they were independent.

**Question 7.** *A proportion of 1% of a population are known to have a
particular disease. A screening test has a 95% chance of detecting the
disease (i.e., of giving a positive result) in an individual who has the
disease. There is also a 6% chance that a disease-free individual will
give a positive result and be thought to have the disease. What is the
probability that a positive result is obtained on an individual chosen
at random from the population? If a positive result is obtained, what is
the probability that the individual does have the disease?*

Let $D$ be the probability individual has a disease and $E$ be the
probability of a positive test result. Then

$$
P(D)=0.01,\quad P(E\vert D)=0.95,\quad P(E\vert D^c)=0.06
$$ 

So the probability
of a positive result is

$$
P(E)=P(E|D)P(D)+P(E|D^c)P(D^)=0.95\times 0.01+0.06\times0.99=0.0689
$$

The probability of having the disease given a positive test is, by Bayes

$$
P(D|E)=\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E)}=\frac{0.95\times0.01}{0.0689}=0.138
$$

**Question 8.** *An urn contains five red balls and one white ball. A
ball is drawn and then it and another ball of the same colour are placed
back in the urn. Finally a second ball is drawn.*

1.  What is the probability that the second ball is white?

2.  If the second ball is white, what is the probability that the first
    was red?

Let $W_i$ be the probability the $i^\text{th}$ ball is white, and $R_i$
the corresponding probability for red.

1.  $P(W_2)=P(W_2\vert R_1)P(R)+P(W_2\vert W_1)P(W_1)=\frac17\frac56+\frac27\frac16=\frac16$

2.  $P(R_1\vert W_2)=\frac{P(W_2\vert R_1)P(R_1)}{P(W_2)}=\frac{\frac17\frac56}{\frac16}=\frac57$
