<span class="amsthmnamedefinition">Remark</span>.          Every set \(S\subset X\) has a finite cover, namely, the cover \(\{X\}\). Compactness is a far stronger property than this.
</p>





</div>

<p>
<b>Example. </b> In discrete metric space, a set is compact if and only if it is finite. All the open balls in a discrete metric space may just be single points, so if there are infinite points, the subcover may not be compact.

<p>
<span class="amsthmproofname">Proof.</span> Let \((x_n)_{n\in \N }\) be a sequence in \(X\) such that \(x_n\in K_n\) for each each \(n\in \N \). Since \(x_n\in K_n\subset K_1\) for all \(n\), and \(K_1\) is sequentially compact, there exists a subsequence
\((x_{n_j})_{j\in \N }\) and some \(x\in K_1\) such that \(x_{n_j}\to x\) as \(j\to \infty \).
</p>

<p>
Prove by contradiction that \(x\in K_{n_k}\) for each \(j\in \N \). Suppose
</p>

<p>
\[ \exists j\in \N \quad x\in X\backslash K_{n_j} \]
</p>

<p>
Every set \(K_{n_j}\) is compact, so closed, so its complement, \(X\backslash K_{n_j}\) is open. So for any point, in particular, for \(x\),
</p>

<p>
\[ \exists \varepsilon &gt;0\quad B^o(x,\varepsilon )\subset X\backslash K_{n_j} \]
</p>

<p>
\(K_{n_j}\subset K_{n_j\star }\), for \(j\ge j\star \), so \(d(x,x_{n_j})\ge \varepsilon \) for all \(j\ge j\star \). This contradicts \(x_{n_j}\to x\) as \(j\to \infty \), since using the nestedness (check!),
</p>

<p>
\[ x\in \bigcap _{j\in \N } K_{n_k}=\bigcap _{n\in \N }K_n \]
</p>

<p>
So \(\displaystyle \bigcap _{n\in \N } K_n\) is non-empty. <span class="theoremendmark">&#x25A1;</span>

<a id="W4-autopage-6"></a>
To show that \(\norm {\cdot }\) is a norm on \(C[a,b]\), hou had to show that if \(f\in C[a,b]\), then \(\norm {f}_1=0\implies f=0\). For this, try contrapositive.
</p>

<p>
If \(f\ne 0\), then
</p>

<p>
\[ \exists c\in [a,b]\quad f(c)\ne 0 \]
</p>

<p>
Then by continuity,
</p>

<p>
\[ \exists \delta &gt;0\ \ \forall x\in [a,b]\qquad \abs {x-c}&lt;\delta \implies \abs {f(x)}&gt;\frac {\abs {f(c)}}2 \]
</p>

<p>
Hence
</p>

<p>
\[ \norm {f}_1\ge \int _{c-\delta }^{c+\delta }\abs {f(x)}\;\d x\ge 2\delta \frac {\abs {f(c)}}2&gt;0 \]
</p>

<p>
Second note, \(\norm {\cdot }\) is not a norm on the space of Riemann integrable functions. Counterexample to this is a discontinuous function. Take a function which differs from \(f(x)=0\) at one point.
