The last part of this course is relatively light since it is more of an introduction to notions that are explored in further courses. It explores which features apply more generally.
</p>

<p>
A topological space is a more abstract notion than a metric space. A metric space \((X,d)\) requires for \(S\subset X\) to be open that
</p>

<p>
\[ \forall x\in S\ \exists r&gt;0\quad B^o(x,r)\subset S \]
</p>

<p>
however in a topological space, you start with the notion of open sets.
</p>

<p>
As should be expected, every metric space forms a topological space for the sets generated by the above definition.
</p>

<p>
Some concepts from metric spaces, whilst others don’t, such as boundedness.
</p>

<p>
The induced topology is, if you like, the default topology that should be assumed for subsets of \(\R \) if no other topology is specified.
</p>

<p>
Continuity can be defined for topological spaces. \(\varepsilon ,\ \delta \) won’t work since these refer to balls. Instead we have to consider open sets.
</p>

<p>
Homeomorphisms are essentially bijections between two topological spaces which are continuous and have continuous inverses. They allow one to remark that the topological structure of two topologies are the same.
</p>

<p>
The questions asked of students about topologies won’t be too abstract; they should refer to ideas well discussed previously.
</p>

<p>
In metric spaces \((X,d)\), convergence \(x_n\to x\) means
</p>

<p>
\[ \forall \varepsilon &gt;0\ \exists N\quad n\ge N\implies d(x_n,x)&lt;\varepsilon \]
</p>

<p>
The definition for topological spaces is essentially the same, but instead of balls \(x_n\in B^o(x,\varepsilon )\) we have open sets \(x_n\in U\).
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, uniqueness of limits does not apply in topological spaces. Something about the metric spaces makes this happen. This is an important property of a Hausdorff space. Hausdorff spaces may be remembered as “housed off”, so for any two points there exist
disjoint open sets \(U,V\) such that \(x\in U,\ y\in V\). Metric spaces are Hausdorff spaces. We also get the result that compact sets are closed. Hausdorffness is a topological property, so is preserved by homeomorphism.

Week 10 gets to the “fun stuff”. It gives a taste of the kind of stuff topologists do.
</p>

<p>
Intuitively, quotient spaces remove the concept of endpoints by glueing them together, imagine glueing the ends of a curve to make a circle.
</p>

<p>
Connectedness is as intuitive as it sounds; connected means not disconnected. Proofs often involve contradictions. Path connectedness connectedness; any two points may be connected by a continuous map. However, the inverse is not true. These are both topological
properties.
</p>

<p>
Topological properties give an easy counterexample to show two topological spaces are not homeomorphic.
</p>

<p>
The bonus content is not examinable, but should be interesting to anyone hoping to study further related courses.
