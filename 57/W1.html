<b>Question&nbsp;1.</b> Explain the difference between the sample space and the event space. Write down the elements of the two spaces for the experiment where a coin is tossed once (use the notation \(H,\ T\) to denote heads and tails). &#x2003;&#x2003;<b>3

The event space is the collection of outcomes; a subset of the sample space, possible individual outcomes. The sample space is \(\Omega =\{H,T\}\) whilst the event space is \(\mathcal {F}=\big \{\emptyset ,\{H\},\{T\},\Omega \big \}\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Question&nbsp;2.</b> Consider an experiment with a countable (but possibly infinite) sample space \(\omega \) in which the individual outcomes are denoted by \(\omega _1,\omega _2,\dots \). Let \(p_1,p_2\dots ,\) be a corresponding set of non-negative
‘weights’ with \(\sum _ip_i=1\). For any event \(E\subseteq \omega \) define

Clearly \(\Omega =E\cup E^c\) and \(E,E^c\) are disjoint. Then by Axiom 2 and 3,

<b>Question&nbsp;7.</b> A proportion of 1% of a population are known to have a particular disease. A screening test has a 95% chance of detecting the disease (i.e., of giving a positive result) in an individual who has the disease. There is also a 6% chance that a
disease-free individual will give a positive result and be thought to have the disease. What is the probability that a positive result is obtained on an individual chosen at random from the population? If a positive result is obtained, what is the probability that the
individual does have the disease? &#x2003;&#x2003;<b>2 Marks</b>

</p>

<p>
Let \(D\) be the probability individual has a disease and \(E\) be the probability of a positive test result. Then
</p>

<p>
\[ P(D)=0.01,\quad P(E\vert D)=0.95,\quad P(E\vert D^c)=0.06 \]
</p>

<p>
So the probability of a positive result is
</p>

<p>
\[ P(E)=P(E\vert D)P(D)+P(E\vert D^c)P(D^)=0.95\times 0.01+0.06\times 0.99=0.0689 \]
</p>

<p>
The probability of having the disease given a positive test is, by Bayes
</p>

<p>
\[ P(D\vert E)=\frac {P(E\vert D)P(D)}{P(E)}=\frac {0.95\times 0.01}{0.0689}=0.138 \]

Let \(W_i\) be the probability the \(i^\text {th}\) ball is white, and \(R_i\) the corresponding probability for red.
