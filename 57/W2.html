<b>Question&nbsp;1.</b> For \(X\) the number of heads on two throws of a coin, find \(E(X)\), \(E(\frac 1{1+X})\). Verify
</p>

<p>
\[ E\left (\frac 1{1+X}\right )\ne \frac {1}{1+E(X)} \]
</p>

<p>
Find \(\displaystyle \text {Var}\left(\frac 1{1+X}\right)\). &#x2003;&#x2003;<b>6 marks</b>

</p>

<p>
By symmetry, \(E(X)=1\).
</p>

<p>
\[ E\left (\frac 1{1+X}\right )=\sum _{x=0}^2\frac 1{1+x}P(x)=1\times \frac 14+\frac 12\times \frac 12+\frac 13\times \frac 14=\frac 7{12} \]
</p>

<p>
Indeed
</p>

<p>
\[ \frac {1}{1+E(X)}=\frac 12\ne \frac 7{12}=E\left (\frac 1{1+X}\right ) \]
</p>

<p>
To find variance,
</p>

<p>
\[ E\left (\left (\frac 1{1+x}\right )^2\right )=1\times \frac 14+\frac 14\times \frac 12+\frac 19\times \frac 14=\cdots \]
</p>

<p>
So
</p>

<p>
\[ \text {Var}\left (\frac 1{1+x}\right )=E\left (\left (\frac 1{1+x}\right )^2\right )-\left (E\left (\frac 1{1+X}\right )\right )^2=\cdots \]

<b>Question&nbsp;2.</b> A sample of two balls is selected at random and without replacement from an urn containing five red, three blue and two white balls. You win two pounds for each blue ball chosen and lose one pound for each red ball. Let \(X\) be your
winnings. Write down the possible values of \(X\) and the corresponding probability mass function. Find your expected profit. What is the probability that you lose more than a pound, given that you do make a loss? &#x2003;&#x2003;<b>5 marks</b>

\(X\) takes values \(-2,-1,0,1,2,4\).

(a) If the true probability of rain is p, find the forecast value \(\hat {p}\) that maximises the expected score. If forecasters receive salary bonuses when they score highly according to this rule, how should they act so as to maximise their salaries in the long run?

(b) In the West of Ireland, rain has occurred on 69% of all days in the last 50 years. In New South Wales, Australia, rain has occurred on 24% of all days. Would it be appropriate to use this scoring rule to compare the performance of Irish and Australian forecasters?

\begin{align*}
E(S)&amp;=\ln \hat {p}E(X)+\ln (1-\hat {p})\big (1-E(X)\big )\\ \dede {E(S)}{\hat {p}}&amp;=\frac {p}{\hat {p}}-\frac {1-p}{1-\hat {p}}
\end{align*}

</p>
  
<p>
When this is zero, \(\hat {p}&amp;=p\)

</li>
<li>
<p>
(b) The score \(S\) is symmetric for \(\hat {p}\) and \(1-\hat {p}\). But \(1-0.24\ne 0.69\), so it still isn’t quite fair.
